        the code is written specially for a very specific filter.  The
        result length is more likely to be a named constant at least,
        representing a frame size.)
 
        The signal length is padded a bit.  This length is not actually
        passed to the vDSP_conv routine; it is the number of elements
        that the signal array must contain.  The SignalLength defined
        below is used to allocate space, and it is the filter length
        rounded up to a multiple of four elements and added to the
        result length.  The extra elements give the vDSP_conv routine
        leeway to perform vector-load instructions, which load multiple
        elements even if they are not all used.  If the caller did not
        guarantee that memory beyond the values used in the signal
        array were accessible, a memory access violation might result.
